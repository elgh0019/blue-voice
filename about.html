        <h2 class="h2">BlueVoice Executive Director Hardy Jones</h2>
        <p><em class="bold">Hardy Jones</em> is a former journalist with CBS News and UPI. He has been
         making television documentaries about the oceans and marine mammals in
         particular for more than 20 years. "The experience of forcing Japanese
         fishermen to release hundreds of dolphins simply by pointing a camera
         at them led to the original concept of BlueVoice.org," says Jones.
         "The advent of the internet has given us a tool of unprecedented power
         to end some of the brutalities committed against marine mammals and the
         oceans."</p>
         <p>
         Our film "If Dolphins Could Talk," hosted by actor Michael Douglas,
         complimented the work of many environmental organizations when we
         broadcast video footage of dolphins dying in tuna nets. Soon afterwards
         Heinz announced it would no longer accept tuna caught by surrounding
         dolphins with nets.</p>
         <p>
         <em class="bold">BlueVoice.org</em> draws on the hundreds of hours of film produced by Hardy
         Jones/Julia Whitty Productions, a leading production company specializing
         in films onthe marine environment.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Ted Danson helps launch bluevoice.org</h2>
        <p>In an effort to leverage the power of the Internet in the cause of
        preserving and restoring the oceans and its creatures, film and television
        star <em class="bold">Ted Danson</em>, a highly respected ocean activist, has joined film producers,
        environmentalists and digital technology partners to launch <em class="bold">BlueVoice.org</em>.</p>

        <p>Material includes streaming video, audio, text, images and animated content.
        We feature annotated video especially prepared for journalists and political
        leaders and provide ways for concerned citizens to communicate with their
        government representatives and to contribute to the preservation of the oceans.<p>

        <h2 class="h2">The BlueVoice philosophy</h2>
        <p>For some twenty five years members of the <em class="bold">BlueVoice</em> team have worked
        both to end the killing of dolphins and whales and to explore the universe
        of dolphins in the open sea. We oppose keeping dolphins in captivity as
        we would oppose capturing human beings for display in circus-like shows.
        Ample evidence now exists to show that dolphins are highly intelligent,
        social and sentient animals with brains and minds of equal magnitude to
        those of humans.</p>

        <p>Our films have brought this point of view to millions of viewers around
        the world. We have spent hundreds of days at sea with dolphins, killer
        whales and sperm whales. We have experienced dolphins protecting us from
        sharks, met newborn calves and swum eye-to-eye with these magnificent
        animals from the Bahamas to Norway's fjords to the Galapagos Islands.
        For all of us the work to protect dolphins and whales is very personal.
        We are dedicated to informing the world about the marvel of these animals
        and ending the threats to their lives.</p>

        <p>At a time in history when we are constructing the world's most sophisticated
        communications infrastructure on the internet we are dangerously neglecting
        the "infrastructure" which supports life on our planet. This is particularly
        true in the marine environment. Life in the oceans is in serious jeopardy
        and none of it is "backed up." If it is destroyed it will not be recoverable.</p>
